# Hey, I'm Jagadheesan

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub — where code, creativity, and a tiny bit of chaos live in harmony.

---

## 🧠 What I'm Building

* **Django + React** projects (currently cooking a **Hall Booking System** called `backend` 😎)
* Crafting a **premium black–white portfolio** with silky-smooth scroll animations and a hero image that refuses to end
* Playing around with simple game ideas (like my multiplayer cube tag game — wholesome chaos)

---

## 💻 Tech I vibe with

* **Python**, Django, Pandas, Numpy
* **JavaScript/TypeScript**, React
* **VS Code** (with way too many extensions)
* **Git & GitHub** (obviously)

## 🎮 Gaming Side Quest

My heart belongs to **Red Dead Redemption 2** (100+ hrs, Arthur Morgan supremacy).
Currently exploring **Elden Ring** and plotting to grab **Cyberpunk 2077** next.

---

## ✨ Creative Universe

* Movies, anime, journaling, art, sketching — if it can be created, I'm in.
* Building a mindset/motivation IG page called **Kovxan**.

---

## 🚀 Current Goals

* Master calisthenics (Spider‑Man rebirth arc loading…)
* Level up as a Python/Django + React full‑stack dev
* Ship more open‑source projects
