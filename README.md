# Hi, I'm Jagadheesan 👋

A curious mind trying to turn **code into art** — one clean script, one smart idea, one late‑night caffeine moment at a time.

## 🚀 What I Do

* Exploring the world of **Data Science** — analysis, insights, and anything that lets data speak.
* Writing Python that’s simple, readable, and actually works.
* Building small game ideas just for fun and creativity.
* Always learning something new, even if it breaks my brain a little.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Python**, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter, Git, VS Code.

## ✨ A Little About Me

* I see coding as a form of **art** — expressive, personal, and limitless.
* Big fan of films, anime, journaling, reading, and drawing.
* Gamer at heart — finished **Elden Ring** long ago but still in emotional recovery.

## 📌 What I'm Focusing On

* Becoming strong in **data science**, step by step.
* Creating meaningful projects that show skill, clarity, and creativity.
* Staying consistent, leveling up, and not being afraid to start again.
